# Charlie Walks: A Novel by Daniel Bourke

This repo contains the code for the website for my first novel, [Charlie Walks](https://www.charliewalks.com) (out now!).

## What's the book about?

Here's the blurb:

*Charlie's a funambulist, a tightrope walker, walking between head and heart between city and nature between a good path and a real path a known path and his own between being a hider and being a seeker between life and death living and dying one option and another another another. The trick is, there's always more than two options. That's where XK-1 comes in. Charlie's secret project. A computer program that shows you what you're supposed to see but can't imagine. A machine learning engineer at the biggest technology company in the world who wants to be a writer. Writing letters to his nephew Pauly. Stories from his past from his present from loving from longing from wandering from walking, step by step creating his own story.*

And here's the cover sketch (the real one is far prettier):
