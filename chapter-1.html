    <p class="content"><i>1. I've died twice.</i></p>
    <p class="content">We were told to write down two facts about ourselves on Post-it Notes and stick them to our hands. One of those team-building exercises. The ones some might call awkward, but I loved these situations, when everyone feels like worms are in their stomach. Worms made me feel alive.</p>
    <p class="content">What the hell, I thought. I hadn’t told anyone but now seemed like a good time. I put the first one down and then the second, then got up and started to walk around.</p>
    <p class="content">I circled the room reading and talking to others about what they wrote about themselves.</p>
    <p class="content">I’ve got two dogs.</p>
    <p class="content">I practice kickboxing.</p>
    <p class="content">I harvest honeybees.</p>
    <p class="content">I’m a rock climber.</p>
    <p class="content">No one else died twice yet.</p>
    <p class="content">The fighter girl circled back and started speaking.</p>
    <p class="content">How can you die twice? she asked.</p>
    <p class="content">Her paper name tag spelled out her name, Sarah. The letters drawn in warm colours which matched her dress.</p>
    <p class="content">I’ve got a heart condition which takes advantage of me now and then but the doctors don’t know what it is.</p>
    <p class="content">Thank you for telling me that, she said.</p>
    <p class="content">Sarcasm or honesty? I couldn’t tell. I kept talking.</p>
    <p class="content">Do you thank people who punch you in kickboxing?</p>
    <p class="content">Only after the fight, she said, then read my other note. So, what do you write about?</p>
    <p class="content">People. Mostly people.</p>
    <p class="content">What about people?</p>
    <p class="content">I like hearing people’s stories and remixing them with my own, I said.</p>
    <p class="content">Are you going to write about me? She smiled.</p>
    <p class="content">You can be in my book if you want.</p>
    <p class="content">You’re writing a book?</p>
    <p class="content">We kept talking, she kept asking questions and I kept spinning answers. It was my turn when the announcement came over.</p>
    <p class="content">OKAY EVERYONE! I hope you’ve learned something fun about your co-workers this morning, we’re going to move to the next activity now.</p>
    <p class="content">We went on to the next thing. I didn’t see Sarah for the rest of the day. After, I walked to the train and caught it home, the whole time wondering what I’d say to her next. Ask her more about the gangsters from Greece, I thought. Yeah, that’s a good idea. Real good.</p>
