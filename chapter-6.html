  <h1>6</h1>
	<p class="block_12">Not much happened over the next three weeks. A project out of the office downtown.</p>
	<p class="block_12">The building had these colourless pillars out front, the inside matched. One notch better or worse than the vibe you get from walking into a funeral home.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Each day I walked up and signed in and they’d hand me the tag. Sometimes there were no tags so I waited while they wrote out a slip. </p>
	<p class="block_12">Keep the slip on you at all times, the security guard said.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Once I had my tag, the security guard would call upstairs and ask for someone to come down. </p>
	<p class="block_12">Morning, I’d say.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Morning. </p>
	<p class="block_12">How are you? </p>
	<p class="block_12">Good and you? </p>
	<p class="block_12">Excellent thanks.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Then we’d go up the lift together.</p>
