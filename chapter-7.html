    <p class="block_12">Another day downtown.</p>
    <p class="block_12">Sarah decided to move overseas. Germany. I’d read writers go to France. The two are close. Where do writers who are technology nerds go?</p>
    <p class="block_12">Back to the problem. I was stuck. I liked where I worked but I liked working on my own project more. </p>
    <p class="block_12">Stay at a large company with all the benefits and comforts a large company can offer or leave and start my own? Two selfish choices. Of course I wanted the best for me. Doesn’t everyone?</p>
    <p class="block_12">I turned it into a story. Two roads. One, into town, well explored, known. The other, out, newfound land or complete ruin. And door number three? Well, I can’t reveal all of my tricks yet.</p>
    <p class="block_12">My issue? </p>
    <p class="block_12">Patience. All the songs talk about wanting something, longing for it. Then when they get it, the songs revert back to the journey.</p>
    <p class="block_12">In my head I was a writer and founder of a company. Charlie the writer, Charlie the company of one. Did I just say that? Yes. Really? Yes. That sounds good, doesn’t it? Real good.</p>
    <p class="block_12">Did other people think these things? Of course they did. Except tragically many of them ever leave the warmup phase.</p>
    <p class="block_12">The lady with the badge came down and said hello and we walked over to the elevators. The doors closed in and my fun thought experiment went silent.</p>
